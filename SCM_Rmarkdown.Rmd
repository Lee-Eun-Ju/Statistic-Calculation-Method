## R Markdown

<!-- 한글로 보고서도 가능? Shift+Ctrl+C(windows), Shift+CMD+C(macOS)-->

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Code Chunks 

```{r}
norm <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
head(norm)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent **printing** of the R code that generated the plot.


## Including dataframe

```{r}
A <- c("a", "a", "b", "b")
B <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)
dataframe <- data.frame(A, B)
plot(dataframe)
```

## Load the .csv file

Note that the `eval= FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent **running** of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dataframe <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Code/dataframe.csv")
```

## Load libraries

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

## Hiding code chunks

If you don’t want the code of a particular code chunk to appear in the final document, but still want to show the output (e.g. a plot), then you can include `echo = FALSE` in the code chunk instructions.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
A <- c("a", "a", "b", "b")
B <- c(5, 10, 15, 20)
dataframe <- data.frame(A, B)
plot(dataframe)
```



Similarly, you might want to create an object, but not include both the code and the output in the final `.html` file. To do this you can use, `include = FALSE`. Be aware though, when making reproducible research it’s often not a good idea to completely hide some part of your analysis:

```{r, include = FALSE}
dataframe <- data.frame(A, B)
plot(dataframe)
```


## Inserting tables 

```{r}
dataframe
```

## Kable() function from knitr package

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(dataframe, digits = 2)
```


## Manually creaing tables

| Plant | Temp. | Growth |
|:------|:-----:|-------:|
| A     | 20    | 0.65   |
| B     | 20    | 0.95   |
| C     | 20    | 0.15   |

## Inserting plots

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color= drv)) + 
     geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv), method = 'loess') +
     geom_point()
```
